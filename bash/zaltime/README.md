Zaltime - A radically stupid time tracker
=========================================

Zaltime is a simple bash script that tracks how long I have worked for the day.
Nothing more.

I tried to keep better track of my workday. However, many of the time trackers
out there are much to complicated for what I want them to do. So I quickly put
together this script that does what I want, which is keeping track of my work
and breaks.

Zaltime allows to add tags to specific times of the day. They have no
functional purpose but to assign textual context to points in time. I use
them to keep track of any special things I was doing roughly at that time.

Dependencies
------------

Unless you run an especially exotic system, you probably have all these
dependencies already installed:
- Bash or compatible shell
- GNU coreutils (date, grep, sort)

Installation
------------

I don't know, put it in your PATH or add an alias to your .bashrc or whatever.

Usage
-----

```
$ zt --help
```
